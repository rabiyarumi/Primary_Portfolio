          Hi, I’m [Your Name], a passionate learner and a budding software developer with an unquenchable curiosity for technology. My journey into programming began with a simple fascination—watching how lines of code could create something meaningful and impactful. I still remember the first time I built a small web page; it felt like unlocking a new world of possibilities.

          <p className="text-lg  leading-relaxed">
            My journey into programming is simple yet exciting—I developed an interest in coding and decided to pursue it wholeheartedly. I enjoy implementing new and creative ideas in my projects, constantly exploring the latest technologies to expand my skills.

            Beyond programming, I have a passion for solving puzzles like Rubik's cubes and indulging in fashion design, where I get to express my creativity in unique ways. These hobbies help me stay inspired and bring a fresh perspective to my coding journey.
